/*ðŸ“‹ Instructions
1. Initialize the queue with front = rear = NULL.
2. Implement enqueueFlight() to add a flight to the rear.
3. Implement dequeueFlight() to remove a flight from the front.
4. Implement peekQueue() to view the next flight to board.
5. Simulate a boarding queue: enqueue flights in order and dequeue them as they board.
